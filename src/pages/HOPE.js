              This is a message for those standing on the edge. For those waiting for the pain to fade, for those feeling lost and alone.

              You are not alone. We all make mistakes. We all feel pain invisible to others. We all feel betrayed, hurt, and misunderstood. But you are not the only one who has felt this way.

              Humans are not perfect. We started out as animals, but we fight to build a society, create rules, laws, and morals to live by. We try to be better, to be kind, loving, compassionate, understanding, forgiving, patient, humble, grateful, and hopeful.
            </p>
            <p>
              But humans are also flawed. We can be selfish, cruel, and hateful. We can be proud, arrogant, vain, lazy, ignorant, fearful, and weak.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beneath it all, we are scared children—afraid of being judged, humiliated, abandoned, rejected, unloved, hurt, betrayed, disappointed, vulnerable, and exposed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The world may seem divided and cruel, but the solution is not to give up. The solution is to find one person you can trust, who will listen, understand, empathize, forgive, and love you.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you can find that one person, you will find hope. You will find a reason to live and be happy. If you can't find that person, let me be that person for you. I will listen, understand, and never judge or hate you. I will empathize, forgive, and care.
            </p>
            <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: '2rem 0' }}>
              <strong>So put down the gun. Throw away the drugs. Step back from the edge. Take a deep breath.</strong>
            </div>
            <p>
              If you feel you have nothing left to live for, let's work together to make a better world—one where we are united as a species. I can't do it alone. I need you, and you need me. Together, we can make a difference.
            </p>
